# reMarkable API python client

[rmapi](https://github.com/juruen/rmapi) is amazing, but no longer maintained. The reMarkable API is [loosely documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1peZh79C2BThlp2AC3sITzinAQKJccQ1gn9ppdCIWLl8/edit). I want a python client, maybe less fully featured than rmapi, but something that lets me easily save files to reMarkable.
